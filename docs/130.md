# Project:  Build a Cash Register
The challenge in this class is to use the language components we have learned to teach the computer how to calculate change.

## Concepts to know
  - Printing text to screen
  - Lists and list indexes
  - For loops
  - Functions and returns

## The lists:
List indexes start at 0 in Python, so the first item is 0, the second is 1, etc. Using [index] after the list name calls the list item that index is associated with.
   ```python
    items = ["Apple", "Milk", "Gum", "Nintendo Switch", "Fidget Spinner",
             "Nike Shoes", "Bread", "Shirt", "Concert tickets"]
    prices = [1.00, 3.50, 0.99, 189.29, 3.00, 79.09, 2.99, 10.00, 99.99]
    ```
If I was to call items[1], the value that would be given to me is “Milk”. If I was to call prices[1] the value that would be returned is 3.50. That means that the price of milk is 3.50, because both items have index 1. If I called items[0] and prices[0] I would be given “Apple” and 1.00.

## For loop:
   ```python
for itemindex in range(len(items)): #for each item in the items list
   print(itemindex+1, "-", items[itemindex], "$%.2f" %prices[itemindex])
    ```
This for loop performs an action for every item in the items list. The len(items) gets the amount of items that are in that list, which should return 9. Then it prints the index of that item so the cashier doesn’t have to type “Apple” (so for “Apple” it should print 0, but that doesn’t make sense to print an item named 0, so we add a one to its index by doing itemindex+1.) We then print the item, and its corresponding price. The cashier uses this index later to determine what the customer ordered by typing in 1, 2, 3, etc.

## Functions:
   ```python
def calculate_price():
   f_cost = 0

   ordered_items = input("\nPlease enter the index of the item(s) "
                         "the customer ordered: ").split(", ")

   for index in range(len(ordered_items)):
       f_cost+= prices[int(ordered_items[index])-1]
   return f_cost

final_cost = calculate_price()
    ```
This function calculates the final price of the ordered items. The user inputs the ordered items based on their index, starting at 1 (because itemindex+1). The items are split at the comma, which returns us a nice list called ordered_items. It then uses a for loop to add the price of each item in the ordered_items list to the f_cost. The function then returns the f_cost value and sets it equal to the final_cost variable.

## Change:
```python
payment = float(input("Please enter payment: $"))
if payment > final_cost:
   difference = payment-final_cost
   print("The customers change is: $%.2f" %difference)
If the payment the user inputs is more than the final cost, give them back the difference in change. The %.2f makes the difference a decimal to the hundreds place, like when using actual money.

Again, you don’t need to type the comments (#) they are just there to explain the code.

print("Here's the list of the items that can be ordered")

#items and prices. The index for each item corresponds to the price for that item
items = ["Apple", "Milk", "Gum", "Nintendo Switch", "Fidget Spinner",
        "Nike Shoes", "Bread", "Shirt", "Concert tickets"]
prices = [1.00, 3.50, 0.99, 189.29, 3.00, 79.09, 2.99, 10.00, 99.99]

for itemindex in range(len(items)): #for each item in the items list
   #prints the item index (why do we need a +1), the item itself and its corresponding price
   print(itemindex+1, "-", items[itemindex], "$%.2f" %prices[itemindex])

def calculate_price():  #the function that calculates the total price of the items ordered
   f_cost = 0

   #gathers the items ordered and splits them at , to get a nice list
   ordered_items = input("\nPlease enter the index of the item(s) "
                         "the customer ordered: ").split(", ")

   for index in range(len(ordered_items)): #for each item in the ordered_items list, add its cost to the final_cost and return it
       f_cost+= prices[int(ordered_items[index])-1]

   return f_cost

#set the final_cost variable equal to the returned value from the calculate_price function
final_cost = calculate_price()
print("The final cost is: $%.2f" % final_cost)  #or use
print("The final cost is: ${:.2f}".format(final_cost))
payment = float(input("Please enter payment: $"))
if payment > final_cost:
   difference = payment-final_cost
   print("The customers change is: $%.2f" %difference)

#you guys come up with a way to check if the customer payed too little

print("Thanks for shopping with us!")
```

##Expansion:
  - Detect if the customer pays too little, and make them pay the rest that they owe (hint use an if/then statement similar to the one that calculates change.)
  - Determine the type of change the customer should get (for example, if the users change is 36 cents, suggest the customer use a quarter, dime, and a penny.) Here's some more help on this: https://falconcoding.wordpress.com/2017/03/27/making-change-virtual-cash-register
