# Python and Geometry
Now we are going to introduce a new tool to help us integrate the syntax we
have learned with geometry.  To do this we will use 'turtle', a module
that lets us draw by moving a turtle around.

## Simple Square
Turtle lets you move, turn, set pen color, and many other things.  Let's
start with an exercise:  draw a square!
>> import turtle
>> t = turtle.Pen()
>> t.pendown()
>> t.forward(100)
>> t.left(90)
>> t.forward(100)
>> t.left(90)
>> t.forward(100)
>> t.left(90)
>> t.forward(100)

## Now to Loop
Can anyone figure out how to simplify the above code?  Usually someone
figures it out pretty quickly that we can use for loops.

>> import turtle
>> t = turtle.Pen()
>> for i in range(4):
>>     t.forward(100)
>>     t.left(90)

## Coding Challenge: N-Sided Shapes
Most students should know how to calculate the interior angle of a polygon.
The coding challenge is to implement a program that asks the user how
many sides to draw on a shape, then draw it.

## Advanced Challenge
Once they have done the above have them experiment some.  What happens if you
loop drawing the shape over and over again at slight angles?  What other cool
patterns can the invent?
