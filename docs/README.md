# Freeport Coding Club Curriculum

## Objectives
Our club is focused on learning to program. It has been established over
years of trial and error and experimenting with different mechanisms for
STEM learning. Our primary objective is to teach middle school students
the basic building blocks of computer science including
- Input/Output
- Data Structures (arrays, dictionaries, sets, etc)
- Algorithms (sorting, aggregating, step-by-step problem solutions)
- Control Structures (decision-making, looping, and branching)
