# Freeport Coding Club Curriculum

## Objectives
Our club is focused on learning to program. It has been established over
years of trial and error and experimenting with different mechanisms for
STEM learning. Our primary objective is to teach middle school students
the basic building blocks of computer science including
- Input/Output
- Data Structures (arrays, dictionaries, sets, etc)
- Algorithms (sorting, aggregating, step-by-step problem solutions)
- Control Structures (decision-making, looping, and branching)

## Initiation
It is impotant that you have the right team if you are going to teach the
students how to code. Prior to the formal coding club starting we have
participated in lots of different learn to code events like Hour of Code.
These events can be tought and facilitated by technical people who don't
necessarily come from a software background. These events showed us
the need for defining what you want to be.

### Teachers
Before initiating the club you need to decide who will be helping
teach/facilitate. If you have a professional software engineer then
you may want to skew the club to things they are comfortable and interested in.
If you have a parent or teacher who is interested in volunteering but will be
learning themselves they you probably want to stick with the standard programs
build around Code.org or the MIT Scratch labs and keep it more classroom-like.
If you have someone handy with electronics then you can skew the club toward
IOT projects. Either way, once you have a key technical volunteer it is helpful
to have another parent or teacher to help facilitate the sessions - especially
if you have more than 5 or 6 students participating.  We have found continuity
is critical and it is very hard to have rotating technical leads unless
you have a rigid curriculum.  Letting a single technical lead faciliate
the club allows the club to be shaped by the students.

### Students
There are a lot of considerations when it comes to shaping the participation
in the club.  Early in our club we just threw it out as a possibility and we
found some things that should be predictable.
- By default you will probably get a very uniform group of kids in all ways.
Lesson here is that you need to explicitly recruit for diversity and make
it fun for everyone.  Focusing on the kids who already tinker is not good
for anyone.
- Every year there will be a different profile so we decided to make the
curriculum flexible, but still have continuity.  But if it is not interesting
to some of the students we have stuck with the plan and been ok with
losing some participation
- Judge the ability of the team to focus and execute - facilitate based on that.
Some years we have totally opened up the curriculum and let the creativity
of the kids drive the project. Other times it is best to be focused and
disciplined to avoid endless tinkering with little learning.

### Style
You have to decide the style of the club. We have tried it all:
- Lecture Style: Each class is a lecture about a topic followed by some
practical work
- On the job training: This style of facilitation is where you carefully
pick projects of escalating challenge that introduce concpepts slowly
then use them in different ways.
-Project style: This style is where the club makes an audactious goal and
breaks it into parts then executes over the course of the weeks or months.

Our club decided early on to be flexible.  Lecture-style for an afternoon
coding club is very challenging so we tend to keep that to a minumum that
and reserve lectures for when we have some complicated conepts to introduce.
In those examples we quickly follow the lecture with fun practicals.  An
example of this is the sorting exercise.

The project style is similarly challenging. This works better with older
students who have some experience or with extremely focused and motivated
students. We have done this with mixed results but in concept it is our
desire to get the students to a point they can take on bigger projects on
their own. A good use case for that was the Limbeck Engineering submersible
project: ![Limbeck Engineering](images/mentoring.jpg)


## Tools of the Trade

### Blocks
Programming with block based tools is a great way to introduce common
students to computer thinking. Early on this was how the Freeport
Coding Club started. These tools are great because they are so
easy to pick up. Early on we were able to very quickly create apps
using AppInventor that solved real problems. This helped us teach
entrepreneurship, prototyping, user testing, and other very
interesting and important skills. Some of our club members ended up
winning some scholarship money in the Maine App Challenge, so it also
proved to be financially beneficial.

Reviewing our objectives - our club is focused on 'coding' - i.e. we want
to learn how to program. Blocks help teach concepts and allow for rapid
prototyping, but we found they did not accellerate the path to
programming in a full programming language like python. Additionally,
most students coming through our school system already have some
exposure to block based programming in their STEM classes so it is becoming
less and less important to review that prior to jumping into programming.
If you have a club that is more focused on entrepreneurial learning
and broader technology then blocks may be a good tool.

### Arduino and Raspberry Pi
Some project ideas require some electronics or 'Internet of Things'.
Depending on the focus of the group we have Raspeberry Pi, Arduino,
and basic elctronics kits available.

### Programming Languages
At some point if you want to learn to 'code' you need to start using modern
programming languages.  We have found that jumping in day 0 using a powerful
but accessable language has been the best approach for our goals. This
becomes a delicate dance of learning a little syntax then doing fun things
with it.
Key Considerations:
*   What types of devices will the students be programming on?
*   What operating system will you be using and how much can you control
what is installed?
*   Do you have a broader objective - e.g. creating a game, mod'ing minecraft,
or creating an app - or are you just trying to teach fundimentals?
*   What is the technical lead's comfort with programming and languages?

Here are our assessments of a few options:
*   Python:
    *   Pros:
        - Fun and easy to use
        - Well accepted standards, but flexible functional versus OO
        - Most marketable (i.e. highest number of open jobs)
        - Open frameworks like Django available
    *   Cons:
        - Not really feasible without a laptop
        - Need a teacher familiar with 'Pythonic' programming
        - Whitespace can trip up new programmers
*   Ruby
    *   Pros:
        - Fun and easy to use
        - 100% Object Oriented if you like that sort of thing
        - Open frameworks like Rails available
    *   Cons:
        - Lots of ways to do one thing
        - Not pervasive marketability
*   Javascript
    *   Pros:
        - Easy to get started right in the browser
        - Pervasive web programming
        - Standard syntax
    *   Cons:
        - Poor standards
        - Some complicated concepts required for break-through
        - Not as marketable on its own
*   Java
    *   Pros:
        - Accessible language
        - Second only to python on marketability
        - Lots of powerful frameworks
    *   Cons:
        - Requires more infrastructure to get started (IDE, compiler etc)
        - More cumbersome to do simple lessons (lots of objects and cruft)
        - Less quick and fun
        - More complicated to do simple graphics programming
*   C or C++
    *   Pros:
        - How I learned!
        - Super powerful and good way to get deep understanding of how computers work
        - Third most pervasive in terms of jobs
    *   Cons:
        - Much less accessible
        - Some infrastructure required (compiler, IDE, etc)
        - Compicated syntax for simple tasks
        - Poor built in graphics support etc

## Lessons
### Intro to Programming
I start every year with a very simiar suite of lessons aimed at teaching the
basics of programming.  Goal is to write code the first day.
