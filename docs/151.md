# Encryption Algorithms

## Overview of Ascii
Ascii is a way to map numbers to letters.  This lets computers easily translate
from binary (0s and 1s) to numbers and then to the letter that number is mapped
to. Here is a visual table showing the ordinal and binary representation of
common english characters.

## Shift Cipher
Since all letters can be mapped to a number, you can come up with a way to
obfuscate english sentences so you could pass notes without others being able to
easily read them.  The easiest way to do this is using a shift cipher.
The shift cipher is a simple letter obfuscation technique where you shift the
ascii ordinal by a number then convert it back to a character.  So if you choose
13 as your shift then an ‘A’ (ordinal 65) gets converted to 78, which is an ‘N’.

## Exercise
Write an encryption and decryption engine!  To avoid having to worry about
encrypt versus decrypt you can chose 13 as the shift, so it is symmetrical
(i.e. A->N and N->A).  If you choose another shift you would need to know which
way you were going which is a good logical next step.
For example, using 10: A->K but K->U.

In the class have them pass notes to each other encrypted - they have fun with
this.

## Advanced
If this is too simple you can start to teach true encryption.  That is not
covered here but is on my list for 300 series classes in the future.
