# Teaching Algorithms

## Introduction
One thing that we have found a fun side class is to teach a little computer
science, specifically about sorting.  The goal here is to give a flavor of
computational thinking.

## Sorting Straws
We learned early on that programming is breaking down problems into steps
and teaching the computer how to accomplish each step.  This exercise takes
it to the next level.  Bring a stack of randomly cut straws of different
sizes.  Explain that the only things you can do are:
1) Create a new pile
2) Select a straw by index from a group of straws
3) Compare 2 straws to see which is longer

Have the students write down (on paper) instructions on how to
put the straws in order by size.  This is usually super interesting by itself!
Test each one by playing the role of the computer - this is best done by
strategically ordering the straws for worst case brute force sorting
to show that the easiest solution can be very bad in terms of points.

## Discussing Performance
Have the students count the comparisons - each time you compare 2 straws things
it costs them a point.  Were all the solutions the same cost?  Can anyone think
of a way to improve the scores?

## Advanced Algothms
If the above goes well you can teach them merge sort and show why it scores
better.
