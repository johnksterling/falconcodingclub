# About the Falcon Coding Club

The Falcon Coding Club has been running at the Freeport Middle School for several
years.  The club has done a wide variety of activities over the years, but
focuses mostly on learning to code in some of the most common languages
in professional software development.

We meet at varying regularity after school and work on a combination of drills
and fun projects. Sometimes we do classroom style learning, but most of the
programming is taught 'on the job' - while solving fun problems.

## Code of Conduct
The Falcon Coding Club is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment
for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.  We do not tolerate
harassment of participants in any form.
