# Intro to Data Structures
In our mad libs exercise we did some pretty cool things, but
the game is pretty boring when the mad libs are the same every time.
One way to solve this is building a list of possible madlibs.

## Arrays, Lists, and Sets
Arrays, Lists, and Sets are just what they sound like, groups
that can be iterated across or randomly accessed.  Sets are special
since they guarentee only 1 instance of each element.  Lists can be:
   ```python
 first_names = ['John', 'John', 'John']
   ```

You can also use the random module to pick a random item from a list:
   ```python
 import random
 first_names = ['John', 'Bob', 'Jim']
 random_name = random.choice(first_names)
 print(random_name)
   ```

## Dictionaries
Dictionaries are key/value pairs.  So I can store a mapping.  For example
if I want to store everyone's weight by name it could be:
   ```python
 weights = dict()
 weights['John'] = 205
 print('John weighs {} pounds'.format(weights.get('John'))
   ```

## Excercise
Augment the madlibs by selecting a random madlib from a list ever round.  Couple
of Input/Ouput syntax examples that might help:
   ```python
 madlibfile = open('madlibs.txt', 'r')
 madlib = madlibfile.readline().strip()
 while madlib:
     madlibs.append(madlib)
     madlib = madlibfile.readline().strip()
   ```
